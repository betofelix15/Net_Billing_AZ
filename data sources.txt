Metadata Updated: April 6, 2024

This dataset, compiled by NREL using data from ABB, the Velocity Suite (http://energymarketintel.com/) and the U.S. Energy Information Administration dataset 861 (http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/), provides average residential, commercial and industrial electricity rates with likely zip codes for both investor owned utilities (IOU) and non-investor owned utilities. Note: the files include average rates for each utility (not average rates per zip code), but not the detailed rate structure data found in the OpenEI U.S. Utility Rate Database (https://openei.org/apps/USURDB/).
